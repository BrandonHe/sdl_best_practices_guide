# SmartDeviceLink FAQ
Here are a few of the most common questions new developers have around the SmartDeviceLink project. 

- [Is WiFi a supported transport?](#is-wifi-a-supported-transport?)
- [Can I implement custom HMI templates?](#can-i-implement-custom-hmi-templates?)
- [Can I implement custom vehicle data messages?](#can-i-implement-custom-vehicle-data-messages?)
- [I didn't find the answers I was looking for, where else can I look?](#i-didn't-find-the-answers-i-was-looking-for,-where-else-can-i-look?)


##Is WiFi a supported transport?<a id="is-wifi-a-supported-transport?"></a>
No. The WiFi transports currently supported are for testing and debugging only; they are not production ready. If this feature is desired, an evolution proposal can be introduced. 

##Can I implement custom HMI templates?<a id="an-i-implement-custom-hmi-templates?"></a>
This is possible, but not recommended as any app that builds itself for the head unit's custom template would not work with any other systems.  If new templates are desired, they should go through the SDL Evolution Process and be adopted by the project.

##Can I implement custom vehicle data messages?<a id="can-i-implement-custom-vehicle-data-messages?"></a>
This is possible, but not recommended as any app that builds itself for the head unit's custom vehicle data types would not work with any other systems.  If new vehicle data types are desired, they should go through the SDL Evolution Process and be adopted by the project.

##I didn't find the answers I was looking for, where else can I look?<a id="i-didn't-find-the-answers-i-was-looking-for,-where-else-can-i-look?"></a>
Each project has documentation, guides, and may have their own FAQ that can help. If you still need help, please join the [SmartDeviceLink Slack team](http://slack.smartdevicelink.com/) and ask  your question.
